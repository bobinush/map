            <p>
                The placement process is a important part in co-creating The Borderland. This is where we all get to decide what goes where! It's also here to make us follow some basic rules so that we can all be safe. (Write some about fire regulations.)
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Don't place your camp on top of someone else's camp.</li>
                <li>Don't place your camp on top of a fire road.</li>
                <li>Don't place your camp on top of a toilet.</li>
                <li>Don't place your camp on top of a tree.</li>
                <li>Don't place your camp on top of a lake.</li>
                <li>Don't place your camp on top of a mountain.</li>
                <li>Don't place your camp on top of a river.</li>
            </ol>   

            <h2 class="content-subhead">What to consider when placing your camp</h2>
            <p>
                There are many things to consider when placing your camp. Here are some examples:
                <ol>
                    <li>Ask for help if overwhelmed! Discord is the quickest way.</li>
                    <li>Talk with your neighbours! Planning a neighbourhood together can be real fun and create all kinds of awesomeness!</li>
                    <li>Placing more public dreams and activites facing outwards to roads, and more private areas behind that can be nice.</li>
                    <li>Are you a loud or silent/chill camp? Look at the soundmap to be guided where you might best fit in!</li>
                    <li>Be guided by the suggested size, but feel free to make a more detailed plan and just use the "Other m2" if needed.</li>
                    <li>Think about how closeness to water and toilets will affect you. If you are far away, bring a bike and trolleys.</li>
                </ol> 
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">FAQ</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Can I only make one shape?</b><br>
                No, you can make more shaped if you need to! It can even be good to differentiate between your camps camping and living areas and your more "public facing" activities and dreams.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>The fire roads are blocking my plans! Can we change them?</b><br>
                A lot of care and thought has gone into the fire road placement, and they are required to be present. However, if you have a good reason to change them, please raise the topic on Discord or Talk and we can discuss it.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Do I have to fill in contact info?</b><br>
                Yes, its important for others to be able to communicate with you! Also, if your camp needs to be moved due to some unforseen fire road adjustment, you might want to be notified...
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>How am I supposed to set up camp in real life??</b><br>
                You will have to carefully measure from the fireroads. Bring a measuring tape, and a string. Use the measure tool in the map to get the right distances. We will add some named "control points" both to the map and in reality, to help out when far away from fire roads.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>It's a very long way to the toilets on the far end of the field!!</b><br>
                Yes indeed it is! Place yourself closer to the toilets if you don't want to walk that far. Pooing in the bushes is a no-no and you will be eaten by the Narwhals if you do. You could also organize extra toilets in the field if that tickles your fancy.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>What is The Borderland Shuffle?</b><br>
                It's when we mess up the placement and have to move everything around. It's a lot of work and a lot of fun.
                The map is not the territory.
