<h1>2024 Placement Guide</h1>
<p>
    üëã Hello! You&rsquo;re here because you want to place your camp somewhere at The Borderland! Placement is an
    important part of co-creating The Borderland and supports project planning, site logistics, and safety (mainly fire
    regulations).
</p>
<p>
    It&rsquo;s also a collaborative process where we all work together to decide what camps, dreams, and experiences go
    where!
</p>
<h2>A Word on Collaboration</h2>
<p>
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Before you dive into the Placement Tool, it&rsquo;s important to understand that collaboration means there are no
    &ldquo;first-come, first-served&rdquo; rights&nbsp;to being placed on the map.
</p>
<p>
    Nothing is final just because someone was there first. Rather, communication, negotiation, and co-creation are
    essential to Placement.
</p>
<p>
    üí¨Please start conversations with your fellow Borderlings about how to organize the neighborhood you&rsquo;d like to
    be in. If your camp is open to more collaboration beyond friendly neighborhood relationships, consider curating a
    plaza with other camps and/or set up communication among the camps in the kvarter (your direct neighbors).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are discussion threads on Discord&nbsp;for each Neighborhood under the NEIGHBORHOODS 2024 category.</li>

<p>
    üôÖ&zwj;‚ôÇÔ∏èIf Discord isn&rsquo;t your thing, feel free to start conversations anywhere else, but definitely have
    someone in your camp check the Discord for an existing conversation about the neighborhood you&rsquo;d like to be
    placed in, just so there are no surprises!
</p>
<h2>The Placement Tool<img title="" src="images/image2.png" alt="Quick help" /></h2>
<p>
    üõ†Ô∏èSome lovely techy Borderlings have built a handy Placement Tool for everyone to place their camps:
    <a
        href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theborderland.se/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1716115390393349&amp;usg=AOvVaw1uWIkk0W-f0VUzi9iTg3ot"
        >https://www.theborderland.se/map
    </a>
</p>
<p>üó∫Ô∏èWhen the process starts, you will be able to draw your camp on the map according to these instructions:</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Click the "Edit" button in the lower left</li>
    <li>Start drawing a shape and close it by clicking on the first point</li>
    <li>
        A box will pop up asking for your camp&rsquo;s information. Fill in all fields, including power needs, sound
        levels, and your contact information (so people can collaborate with you!)
    </li>
    <li>
        Pay attention to how much space it says your camp needs depending on how many people are in tents or vehicles.
        Other stuff in m&sup2; means anything else, like kitchen tents, domes, artwork, chill spaces etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Try using the measurement tool (the 4th icon down at top-left) to measure the footprint of your camp or measure
        distances to toilets or other landmarks.
    </li>
    <li>Click "Ok!".</li>
    <li>
        Once placed, you can click on your camp to get an "Edit shape" button to adjust your footprint, move your camp,
        or edit your camp&rsquo;s info.
    </li>
    <li>Done!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Fire Buffers</h3>
<p>
    üî•While editing your shape, pay attention to the thin dotted black line around your shape. That is the "fire
    buffer", and is drawn 5 meters away. This tool is to help guide you and applies mainly to large camps, kitchens, and
    other fire hazards. If you're placing small camps or sleeping spots, use common sense. And remember to design some
    space for paths so fellow borderlings intuitively know where it's safe to walk :)
</p>
<p><img title="" src="images/image3.png" alt="Fire buffer zone" /></p>
<h3>Other Map Layers</h3>
<p>üç∞Make sure to check out the slope map, soundmap, heightmap and a bunch of other layers in the top right menu!</p>
<p><img title="" src="images/image4.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>I&rsquo;m seeing a flag on my polygon (aka: what are the placement rules?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The maximum size for one area or a group of areas is 1250m&sup2;. If your space requirements are larger than
        that, make two (or more) polygons.
    </li>
    <li>Check that the borders of your polygon aren&rsquo;t overlapping with the 5m buffer of another polygon.</li>
    <li>Place your camp inside the placement areas (yellow borders) and not on a fire road.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Note that non-camping structures may be placed in plazas. Because plazas are treated by the map as fire roads,
        this will trigger a warning. It&rsquo;s fine as long as you&rsquo;ve maintained 5m corridors that can act as
        fire roads around or through your plaza.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>You must fill in all info fields. Contact info is important! Without it, your area might be removed.</li>
    <li>
        Confirm your sound intentions match the sound requirements of your zone. See the<a

    </li>
</ul>
<h2>What to consider when placing your camp</h2>
<p>There are many things to consider when placing your camp. Here are some examples:</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>
        Placing more public dreams and activities outwards facing the road, and more private areas behind that can be
        nice.
    </li>
    <li>Are you a loud or silent/chill camp? Look at the soundmap to be guided where you might best fit in!</li>
    <li>
        Be guided by the suggested size, but feel free to make a more detailed plan and just use the "Other m2" if
        needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Think about how closeness to water and toilets will affect you. If you are far away, bring a bike and trolleys.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do you want to be part of a plaza? Talk with other camps to align efforts! Planning a plaza together can be real
        fun and create all kinds of awesomeness!
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask for help if overwhelmed!

<h2>Basic fire rules</h2>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Inside your camp normal tents for living do not need separation.</li>
    <li>Larger structures, kitchen tents, RVs and vans need 4 meters between them and something else that can burn.</li>
    <li>All camps should have at least one fire extinguisher.</li>
    <li>The fire roads outside your camp or your camp cluster must be kept clear at all times.</li>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>
    Can I only make one shape?<br />No, you can make more shapes, if you need to. It can even be good to differentiate
    between your camp&rsquo;s living areas and your more "public facing" activities and dreams.
</p>
<p>
    The fire roads (red) or walkways (blue)are blocking my plans! Can we change them?<br />A lot of care and thought
    have gone into the road placement. The fire roads are required to be present. The walkways contribute to
    accessibility and connections. However, if you have a good reason to change them, please raise the topic on Discord
    or Talk and we can discuss it.
</p>
<p>
    Do I have to fill in contact info?<br />Yes, it&rsquo;s important for others to be able to communicate with you!
    Also, if your camp needs to be moved due to some unforeseen fire road adjustment, you might want to be notified...
</p>
<p>
    How am I supposed to set up camp once arriving at The Borderland <br />You will have to carefully measure from the
    main fire roads, that will be marked beforehand by a group of people (Help needed!). Bring a measuring tape, and a
    string. Use the measure tool in the map to get the right distances. We will add some named "control points" both to
    the map and in reality, to help out when far away from fire roads.
</p>
<p>
    It's a very long way to the toilets on the far end of the field!!<br />Yes indeed it is! Place yourself closer to
    the toilets if you don't want to walk that far. Pooing in the bushes is a no-no and you will be eaten by the
    Narwhals if you do. You could also organize extra toilets in the field if that tickles your fancy.
</p>
<p>
    What is The Borderland Shuffle?<br />It's when we mess up the placement and have to move everything around. It's a
    lot of work and a lot of fun. The map is not the territory, people often confuse models of reality with reality
    itself you see (see Alfred Korzybski).
</p>
<p>
    I want to be involved in a plaza, how does it work? <br />Try to bring a few camps together that have the same
    vision and level of engagement. Start a discussion on Discord expressing your interest in curating the plaza. This
    is the first year we are trying this so trial and error are likely to happen. There is no need to get permission and
    no option to claim the space, rather collaboration is encouraged around plazas.
</p>
<p>
    I don't have a camp, how do I proceed?<br />If you want to join a camp you can look for a camp with open spots. You
    can also ask on

    I will go and create my own camp, but with blackjack and hookers...<br />Great! Make sure to pick a spot for it in
    the placement map. And if you seek members, spread the word in the above channels.
</p>
<p>
    I'm so radical and self-reliant that I don't belong in a camp!<br />The concept is called freecamping and if you're
    taking up somewhat of a space that could be taken by other camps you should also use the placement process.<br />Some
    freecampers still do cooking together and reserve a bigger area for freecampers, feel free to find other freecampers
