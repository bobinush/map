<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>
    <b>Can I only make one shape?</b><br />No, you can make more shapes, if you need to. It can even be good to
    differentiate between your camp's living areas and your more "public facing" activities and dreams.
</p>
<p>
    <b>The fire roads (red) or walkways (blue)are blocking my plans! Can we change them?</b><br />A lot of care and
    thought have gone into the road placement. The fire roads are required to be present. The walkways contribute to
    accessibility and connections. However, if you have a good reason to change them, please raise the topic on Discord
    or Talk and we can discuss it.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Do I have to fill in contact info?</b><br />Yes, it's important for others to be able to communicate with you!
    Also, if your camp needs to be moved due to some unforeseen fire road adjustment, you might want to be notified...
</p>
<p>
    <b>How am I supposed to set up camp once arriving at The Borderland</b><br />You will have to carefully measure from
    the main fire roads, that will be marked beforehand by a group of people (Help needed!). Bring a measuring tape, and
    a string. Use the measure tool in the map to get the right distances. We will add some named "control points" both
    to the map and in reality, to help out when far away from fire roads.
</p>
<p>
    <b>It's a very long way to the toilets from where I'm camping!</b><br />Yes indeed it is! Place yourself closer to
    the toilets if you don't want to walk that far. Pooing in the bushes is a no-no and you will be eaten by the
    Narwhals if you do. You could also organize extra toilets in the field if that tickles your fancy.
</p>
<p>
    <b>What is The Borderland Shuffle?</b><br />It's when we mess up the placement and have to move everything around.
    It's a lot of work and a lot of fun. The map is not the territory, people often confuse models of reality with
    reality itself you see (see Alfred Korzybski).
</p>
<p>
    <b>I want to be involved in a plaza, how does it work?</b><br />Try to bring a few camps together that have the same
    vision and level of engagement. Start a discussion on Discord expressing your interest in curating the plaza. This
    is the first year we are trying this so trial and error are likely to happen. There is no need to get permission and
    no option to claim the space, rather collaboration is encouraged around plazas.

<p>
    <b>I don't have a camp, how do I proceed?</b><br />If you want to join a camp you can look for a camp with open
    spots. You can also ask on

    <b>I will go and create my own camp, but with blackjack and hookers...</b><br />Great! Make sure to pick a spot for
    it in the placement map. And if you seek members, spread the word in the above channels.
</p>
<p>
    <b>I'm so radical and self-reliant that I don't belong in a camp!</b><br />The concept is called freecamping and if
    you're taking up somewhat of a space that could be taken by other camps you should also use the placement
    process.<br />Some freecampers still do cooking together and reserve a bigger area for freecampers, feel free to
    find other freecampers at the
